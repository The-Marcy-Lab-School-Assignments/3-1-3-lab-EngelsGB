# Question

When we say "use semantic elements," what does that mean?

Please be sure to give an example of a semantic and non-semantic element in your explanation.

# Answer

Semantic elements are html elements whose name is self-explanatory and/or intuitive. Examples of semantic elements are `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`. On the other hand, examples of non-semantic element are `<div>` and `<span>` because these tell us nothing about their contents.
