# Question

What are at least 2 benefits to using:

```html
<script type="module" src="index.js"></script>
```

Instead of:

```html
<script src="index.js"></script>
```

# Answer

1. Module type scripts can import and export code, the one added into the html will most likely be a runner function file that imports all the functions and variables from other files and runs them.

2. Module type scripts can import files of types other than .js.
